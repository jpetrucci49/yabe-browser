## Structure

Currently, the top-level `Auth` component stores the currently authenticated
user in state, as well as data related to the flash messages. `Auth` renders the
`Header` component, and a list of routes, each of which render a component from
`src/auth/components`. The `auth` directory has two non-component files, `api`
and `messages`, which contain all the needed `fetch` calls, and messages to
display when API calls succeed or fail, respectively.

## Features

### `<AuthenticatedRoute />`

Component for creating routes that require a
user to be authenticated before visiting. This component lives in
`src/auth/components/AuthenticatedRoute.js` and is already required in `Auth`.
It's a thin wrapper around React Router's `<Route />` component. The only
difference is that it expects a prop called `user`, and if that prop is falsy,
it will render a `<Redirect />` that takes the user to `/`. **If you want to use
it, you must pass it the currently authenticated as a prop!**

It supports both the `component=` and `render=` attributes, but like `<Route />`
it will not forward props to the component if you use `component=`.

### Flash Messages

The `Auth` component has a rudimentary version of flash messages. To use it,
pass `this.flash` into a subcomponent of `Auth` as a prop and call it from there.
It expects two arguments: a message to display, and a message type, which is one
of `'flash-success'`, `'flash-warning'`, and `'flash-error'` which make the
message green, yellow, and red, respectively. You must pass one of these types.
You can add more types by adding more CSS rules in `Auth.scss`.

In the auth components, flash messages are used in conjunction with the
 `auth/messages` file to select from a list of predefined success/failure
 messages. To undertand how to do this, look at the definition of `flash` in
 `Auth.js`, the `signUp` method in `auth/components/SignUp.js`, and the
 `auth/messages.js` file.

 To change the duration of the message, replace `2000` with a value of your
 choice (in milliseconds) in the `flash` method definition in `Auth.js`.
